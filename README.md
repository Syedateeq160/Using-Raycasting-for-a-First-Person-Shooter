# Raycasting Assignment

## Important Notice
**N.B.:** This is an individual assignment. All team members must complete and submit it separately.

## Learning Raycasting
Use the linked tutorial to learn more about **Raycasting**, how it can be used for **aiming** and **registering hits**.

The tutorial demonstrates a **First Person Shooter (FPS)** example. However, the concept can also be applied in other scenarios such as:

- **Detecting when a player is looking at something** and triggering a sound or animation.
- **Making the player interact with objects** only when they are facing them (i.e., pointing their camera at the object's collider, which may be larger or smaller than the object itself).
- **Detecting whether an object (player or other) is standing on the ground** (although using triggers may be more efficient).

The tutorial is available in both **video** and **article** formats. Choose the one that suits your preference.

## Using the Free Asset Package
To use the **free asset package** provided with the tutorial from the Unity Asset Store:

1. **Sign in** to the Unity Asset Store using your Unity account.
2. **Add the package** to your account by purchasing it (it's free).
3. **Include the package in your project** by following these steps:
   - Open your Unity project.
   - From the main toolbar, navigate to `Window > Package Manager` to open the **Package Manager**.
   - At the top of the **Package Manager** window, locate the dropdown labeled **"Packages: In Project"** and select **"My Assets"**.
   - Find the **"Let's Try Assets"** package.
   - Click the **Download** and **Import** button (located at the bottom right corner of the **Package Manager** window) to include the assets in your project.
